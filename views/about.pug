            | Hi, my name is James and I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer.
            | I have been learning code since 2018 and fell in love with trying to figure out how it all worked.
            | I enrolled in Team Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree program because I needed to know more.
            | I chose to learn JavaScript because I love how much you can do with it, from adding interactivity to 
            | creating routes and a server, the possibilities seem endless!
            | Let's take these endless possiblilites and make something awesome together!
