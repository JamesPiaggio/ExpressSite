# ExpressSite
Portfolio site using Express and Pug

## What it does
This website is made using the Express framework along with using Pug templates to provide multiple different webpages for the routes created with Express.  With this website, you will see my past projects I build with JavaScript and various other tools.  Click on the project image you would like to view and that will direct you to that project page. There you can view more screenshots and it even provides a live demo link along with a link to my github repo.
